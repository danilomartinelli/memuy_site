# Memuy site
Memuy is file share system made to make easy the process of sharing a file for a short amount of time. It doesn't require any kind of authentication. It only sets a maximum size and a period while that file will be available.

This repository has only the front-end part of Memuy: a React web app that uses mobX to manage states.  

## How to run

First, install all the project depencies by running: `npm i` or if you are a yarn fan like me `yarn`.

In order to run webpack-dev-server on port 7005 you need to execute: `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
